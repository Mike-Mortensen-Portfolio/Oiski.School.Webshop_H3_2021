See the [Wiki](https://github.com/ZhakalenDk/Oiski.School.Wepshop_H3_2021/wiki) for more in depth information about the project.

## Versioning
Versioning is coordinated according to the following template: [_Major_].[_Minor_].[_Path_].\
Each `Feature` must be branched out and developed on an isolated branch and merged back into the `Developer` branch when done.

The syntax for the structure of branch folders must be presented as: [DeveloperName]/[MajorVersion]/[BranchName], where as [BranchName] should be formatted as follows: [Feature]_[SubFeature].\
**Example:**
>**Folder Structure:** _Oiski/v1_ \
>**Branch Name:** _Interface_MainMenu_ \
>**Full Path:** _Oiski/v1/MainMenu_UIOverhaul_
